It's lit!

PRs welcome! The CSS is super hacky, the design needs work, I depend on a weird library called packard-belle when I should really be writing these styles myself, there's `<div><div><div></div></div></div>`s everywhere, and it scales terribly on different screen sizes. <3 to anyone who contributes :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Make sure you're running a cors-anywhere proxy at localhost:8080.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
